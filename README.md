# Electric-guided-vehicle-routing-problem-
Based on the study of the vehicle routing problem and the ant colony algorithm, this program builds an electric guided VRP model considering the constraints of battery capacity, cargo loading, and node access. This model man-ages to formulate the operation rule using fast, low energy consumption and punctuality as indicators. Based on the mathematical model constructed, the model is solved by the ant colony algorithm, and the improved artificial potential field method is used to avoid obstacles, so as to arrange a reasonable driving route for the vehicles.
